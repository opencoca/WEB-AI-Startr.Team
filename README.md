## What We Do 💡

At Startr.Team, our agents work together in a multi-agent organization, all sharing one big mission: **"To revolutionize the digital world through collaboration."** Whether designing, coding, testing, or documenting, our agents team up in specialized seminars to get the job done. 

Our main goal is to offer you an **easy-to-use**, **customizable**, and **expandable** framework that makes your project journey smooth and successful—built on cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), Startr.Team is also a perfect playground for exploring how teamwork and technology can tackle any challenge.

## Getting Started 🛠️

Ready to dive in? Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

First things first, let's set up your development environment. Run the following command:

```bash
make a_dev_env
```

This will ensure that all necessary tools, such as brew, pipenv, and pyenv, are installed and ready to use.

### 2. Explore Makefile Commands

To see all the available `make` commands, just run:

```bash
make help
```

This will list everything you can do with our setup, from installing your environment to cleaning your project.

### 3. Ready for a Release?

Startr.Team makes releasing your project a breeze. Choose from a minor, patch, or major release with simple `make` commands:

```bash
make minor_release
make patch_release
make major_release
```

Once you're done, finish up your release with:

```bash
make release_finish
```

This will push everything to `develop`, `main`, and even tag it for you!

### 4. Keep Your Workspace Clean

To keep things tidy, you can clean your Git repository with:

```bash
make clean_git_repo
```

## Dependencies 📦

Here’s what you’ll need to get going, all neatly packed in our `Pipfile`:

- **Python** 3.9
- Essential libraries like `numpy`, `requests`, `flask`, and more
- Tools for development like `viztracer` and `autoflake`

Don’t worry; just run `pipenv sync -d` to get all dependencies sorted out!
